~This is my first repo so dont mine nooby mistakes~This project is directed for people who strugle with SPD ( Sensory Processing Disorder). A person with SPD struggles everyday, in the city, too much noise and light, in the country-sid, smell and sound. So for those people, i made a gadget that you can make too!
